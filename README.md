> "I would make a recommendation of comparing at least 3 different MPI algorithms performance in C/C++ vs the same algorithm in Python or Rust as your primary inquiry question. Opt for a dockerized comparison as an add-on if you have time. Iâ€™ve gotten MPI running in K8s and it was far from trivial and that was ignoring the testing, algorithms, etc that I would want you to write to test the performance differences."
